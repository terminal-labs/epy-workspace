- Came out of Mozilla
- Moved out of Mozilla
- Takes @ 10 secs to load but runs in worker so won't block main UI thread

Packages:

- binary packages included in Pyodide (numpy, etc.)
- micropip pure Python
- C/Cython/C++/Fortran packages: set up Pyodide build environment

Using Pyodide in web app

- Pyodide as replacement for JS
- Run interactive Python in browser (JupyterLite)
- As replacement for Python backend API (no web request)

Case Study: Date Science App for a University Course

- Problem: distribute data science app to mech engineering students that can be run
  on a wide range of computers (university and student-owned)
- https://github.com/mgreminger/response-surface-pareto
- svelt for JS/UI
- plotly.js

Potential Roadblocks

- Early days for Pyodide + Wasm
- Stack size is limited so recursion limit is low
- No Safari
- Old SciPy (Fortran compilation issues)
- Large/complicated modules can be difficult to package for Pyodide
- Debugging

Q+A

Q: What alternatives did you consider?
