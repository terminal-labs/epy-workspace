NOTE (CCL):

This was started as a Flask/matplotlib -> <canvas> demo. Mike and I decided to abandon
Flask and work in static HTML to visibly demo more of the <py-script> functionality
more directly. Would serve as a nice Flask wrapper for a new project if we need it.

conda env = mpl-flask

1. Traditional
2. Manipulate canvas in python
3. Pyodide/python/matplotlib/JS (look at d3 example)
